# V9.2 Data-First Alpha Plan

## Decision

V9.2 alpha research is blocked from its highest-priority families until a
verified historical L2 and derivatives data inventory exists.

The repo has a trustworthy six-year spot aggTrades and volume-bar foundation.
It does not yet have the point-in-time L2, spread, depth, queue, funding, open
interest, liquidation, basis, whale-flow, macro, correlation, or options-gamma
history required to test the recovered strategy architecture honestly.

Update: verified BTCUSDT orderbook L2 history is present on cold storage for
the period `2025-06-28` through `2026-06-07`. That is enough to backtest
order-book-derived diagnostics such as imbalance, microprice, MLOFI, spread,
spoof/iceberg proxies, and execution-quality gates. It is not a six-year L2
archive, so the funding/OI/liquidation/crowding families remain blocked until
their own point-in-time histories are verified.

The first L2 shadow-backtest smoke run completed against a one-file sample and
confirmed the pipeline works end to end. That smoke is not evidence of edge; it
only proves the orderbook replay, feature extraction, and cost-adjusted report
generation are operational.

No L2 or derivatives feature may be promoted, or even reported as historically
tested, until its source manifest and timestamp audit pass.

## Completed Prerequisites

- Verified six-year spot aggTrades coverage and deterministic 300 BTC catalog.
- Immutable signal and path replay methodology.
- Explicit cost stress and monthly walk-forward framework.
- D4 purity, recovered-context, exit, and bar-size/horizon closure.
- Final D4 surface run completed once.
- D4 retained only as research benchmark.

The final D4 surface found one limited lead: approximate 500 BTC / 10-bar D4.
That lead requires an exact raw-trade 500 BTC catalog and walk-forward
validation. It does not reopen general D4 TP/SL research.

## Phase 1 — Bybit Historical Inventory

Bybit historical inventory/download is the first V9.2 data priority because
the next alpha families require futures positioning, liquidation, and L2
context.

Inventory candidate sources for:

- L2 snapshots and incremental depth updates;
- trades with aggressor side;
- best bid/ask and spread;
- open interest;
- funding;
- liquidations;
- mark, index, and perpetual prices;
- basis/premium;
- long/short ratios if available.

For BTCUSDT orderbook L2, the currently verified local cold-store archive is:

- `orderbook/binance_futures/BTCUSDT`
- coverage: `2025-06-28` to `2026-06-07`
- file format: hourly `*.parquet.zst`
- source path: `/mnt/seagate/tm-trading-v555/data/raw/cryptohftdata/orderbook/binance_futures/BTCUSDT`

For every source record:

```text
venue
instrument
market type
data type
archive URL/path
file checksum
file size
first/last event timestamp
first/last availability timestamp if different
row/update count
sequence range
missing sequence count
duplicate count
timestamp monotonicity
parse status
schema version
```

Do not download blindly. First create an exact inventory and download plan.

## Phase 2 — Verification Foundation

Before feature construction, implement:

1. Deterministic source manifests and hashes.
2. Gap, overlap, duplicate, corruption, and sequence checks.
3. Resumable download and parsing.
4. Small sample parsers with fixture tests.
5. Point-in-time availability timestamps.
6. Spot/futures/L2 clock-alignment diagnostics.
7. Explicit source caveats and coverage waivers.

Hard failure conditions:

- missing or reordered L2 update sequences;
- unclear snapshot/delta reconstruction semantics;
- derivatives values without point-in-time publication timestamps;
- silent missing intervals;
- unverifiable archive identity;
- inability to reproduce feature hashes.

## Phase 3 — Regime Classifier Before Signal Sweeps

Build the past-only regime classifier before testing new alpha thresholds.

Initial regimes from verified spot data:

- trend/range;
- volatility: low/medium/high/extreme;
- session: Asia/London/NY/London-NY overlap/other;
- VWAP state: above/below/near/extended;
- auction state: inside value/outside value/near POC/above VAH/below VAL;
- volume and bar-duration state.

Add only after verified data exists:

- spread/depth/liquidity regime;
- toxicity regime;
- funding/OI/crowding regime;
- liquidation state;
- macro/risk state.

Architecture:

```text
past-only regime state
-> immutable alpha-family opportunity
-> isolated feature attribution
-> cost-aware eligibility label
-> chronological replay
```

The classifier does not emit trades. It labels context and selects eligible
alpha families using train-only evidence.

Acceptance:

- deterministic states;
- no future-confirmed swings;
- state definitions frozen before each test period;
- transition and unclassified-state reporting;
- 2020-2023 and 2024-2026 results;
- no arbitrary confluence score.

## Phase 4 — Under-Tested Spot Diagnostics

While L2/derivatives data is being acquired, complete low-cost diagnostics that
the verified spot foundation supports:

1. Session quality by alpha family and cost model.
2. Volatility-regime attribution.
3. Session VWAP distance, reclaim, rejection, and migration.
4. Deterministic anchored-VWAP experiments using observable anchors only.
5. Auction-state transitions: POC/value migration, acceptance, rejection, and
   failed auction.
6. Volume-bucket VPIN variants, honestly labeled as tape-based toxicity
   diagnostics.
7. Exact raw-trade 500 BTC / 10-bar D4 validation.
8. L2 orderbook backtests for imbalance, microprice, MLOFI, spread, spoofing,
   iceberg/refill proxy, and queue-quality diagnostics over the verified
   2025-06 to 2026-06 window.

These diagnostics remain feature research. They cannot become score-based
gates.

## Phase 5 — L2 Alpha Families

After L2 verification passes, build:

- OFI and MLOFI;
- microprice imbalance;
- spread/depth state;
- absorption and true refill/iceberg features;
- liquidity sweep/reclaim;
- toxic-flow avoidance;
- queue-aware passive-entry simulation.

Required reporting:

- point-in-time feature availability;
- latency ladder;
- taker and empirically calibrated maker scenarios;
- fill rate and adverse selection;
- blocked-winner/blocked-loser accounting for gates;
- 2024-2026 post-cost expectancy;
- chronological walk-forward.

Maker-first execution remains blocked until queue-aware fill assumptions can be
supported by historical data.

## Phase 6 — Derivatives And Forced-Flow Families

After derivatives verification passes, build:

- funding and OI state;
- funding + OI squeeze;
- liquidation cascade reversal and continuation;
- perp basis/premium;
- long/short crowding;
- normalized whale aggressive flow.

Each feature must use the value known at the decision timestamp, not a
retrospectively revised or later-published value.

Required reporting:

- source and availability timestamp;
- missingness by year/month;
- standalone attribution;
- interaction with regimes;
- recent post-cost expectancy;
- latency and publication-delay stress.

## Phase 7 — Dynamic Exit Lab

Dynamic exits are evaluation overlays, not alpha.

Evaluate only after an alpha family has positive post-cost opportunity
expectancy:

- MFE/MAE distributions;
- trailing after MFE;
- breakeven after MFE;
- CVD/OFI reversal;
- auction invalidation;
- time stop;
- staged/partial exits;
- hard disaster stop.

Reject any exit that improves win rate while reducing net expectancy.

## Phase 8 — Cost-Aware Meta-Labeling

The final V9.2 architecture predicts whether an immutable setup is tradeable
after costs.

Inputs may include:

- D4 and other weak alpha primitives;
- regime state;
- VWAP/auction state;
- L2 pressure and toxicity;
- derivatives/crowding state;
- execution-quality state.

Labels:

- net profitable after explicit cost ladder;
- MFE-before-MAE;
- triple barrier;
- clean trade path;
- maker/taker eligibility where supported.

Rules:

- time-series splits only;
- no random shuffle;
- features timestamped before labels;
- calibrated probability buckets must map monotonically to recent realized
  expectancy;
- model accuracy alone is irrelevant.

## Build Order

1. Inventory Bybit and alternative historical L2/derivatives sources.
2. Generate download plan; verify samples, schemas, gaps, sequences, and
   checksums.
3. Build regime classifier from currently verified spot data.
4. Complete session, volatility, VWAP, auction-transition, and exact 500 BTC
   diagnostics.
5. Build timestamp-aligned multi-source feature ledger.
6. Test OFI/microprice and absorption first.
7. Test VPIN/toxicity as alpha and risk filter separately.
8. Test liquidation and funding/OI forced-flow families.
9. Run dynamic exits only on positive candidates.
10. Build cost-aware meta-labeling and family selection.

## Universal Promotion Gate

No V9.2 alpha, context gate, execution rule, or meta-label may advance unless:

- data source and feature manifest pass;
- no same-bar or publication-time lookahead exists;
- no future-confirmed swing is used;
- 2024-2026 post-cost expectancy is positive;
- recent sample size is sufficient;
- bootstrap confidence interval is acceptable;
- monthly walk-forward median test expectancy is positive;
- positive test split rate exceeds 55%;
- cost and latency stress do not collapse the result;
- no single year or regime explains most profit;
- every component has isolated attribution;
- no arbitrary score or AI trade decision is used.

## Stop Conditions

Stop a research family when:

- required source data cannot be verified;
- recent post-cost expectancy is non-positive across reasonable definitions;
- apparent value disappears under publication-delay or latency stress;
- feature value depends on future confirmation;
- improvement comes only from capital sizing or opportunity suppression;
- walk-forward repeatedly rejects it.
