# V9.2 Strategy Memory Ledger

## Purpose

This ledger preserves useful concepts recovered from the Mistral strategy
export without reviving unsupported claims, arbitrary confluence scores, or AI
trade decisions.

Recovered source documents:

- `elite_90plus_strategy.md`
- `Ultimate_Crypto_Trading_Automation_Guide.md`
- `PROFESSIONAL_TRADING_SYSTEM_RUNDOWN.md`
- user-provided `V92_MISTRAL_STRATEGY_RECOVERY_INPUT.md` contents

The recovered architecture is:

```text
market regime
-> setup eligibility
-> order-flow confirmation
-> execution-quality gate
-> dynamic exit management
```

Every concept below must become a measurable, timestamp-safe diagnostic before
it can influence trade eligibility.

## Status Definitions

| data-blocked | Required verified historical source is unavailable |
| implementation-blocked | Data exists or may exist, but reliable implementation is missing |
| V9.2 priority | Approved next research work after prerequisites |
| archived | Retained only for historical context; do not revive directly |

## Immediate Decisions

1. Do not revive D4 as a strategy.
2. Do not run new alpha sweeps before a regime ledger exists.
3. Prioritize verified historical Bybit L2 and derivatives inventory.
4. Treat existing L2/OFI/MLOFI/iceberg code as implementation scaffolding, not
   validated research.
5. Use dynamic exits and risk controls only after a new alpha has positive raw
   or filtered post-cost expectancy.
6. Use D4 as a benchmark feature in cost-aware meta-labeling, never as an
   automatic trade rule.
